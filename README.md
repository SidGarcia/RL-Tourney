# Rules  
Each team must participate with at least two members of their team in each match.  
If one team fails to meet this criteria, the other team will go to the next round.  
If both teams fail to do so, the team with any participating member will go to the next round.  
Otherwise it will go to a coin toss.  
If both teams have only two participating members in a match, they can play a 2v2 match.  

# Double elimination
The basics of a double elimination tournament is that a team has to lose twice to be out of the tournament.  
The first round of matches will decide who goes to the winner's bracket and loser's bracket.  
If your team loses a round in the loser's bracket, you are out of the tournament with the option to sub for other teams.  

If both teams agree, you may make your round Best of 5 matches instead of 3.
